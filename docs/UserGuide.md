> * If a command includes the start time, it must have an end time, otherwise it is an invalid command.

### 2.3. Listing all tasks : `list`

Shows a list of all tasks in the Task Manager.<br>
Format: `list`

### 2.4. Editing a task : `edit`

Edits an existing task in the Task Manager<br>
Note: when editing the date & time of a task<br>
both date and time must be put, only format allowed is dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm. e.g. 31/10/2017 16:30
Format: `edit [INDEX] [TASK-NAME] from/[DD/MM/YYYY] [HH:MM] to/[DD/MM/YYYY] [HH:MM]p/[PRIORITY-LEVEL] t/[KEY-WORD]...`

> * Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`.
    The index refers to the index number shown in the last task listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
> * At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
> * Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:

* `edit 1 from/23/03/2017 19:00`<br>
  Change name of task at index 1 to "go home"

* `edit 1 from/23/03/2017 19:00 to/23/03/2017 19:10 p/high`<br>
  Change start and end times of timed tasks
  
* `edit 1 newTaskName`
  Change the name of a task only

#####Converting the type of a task

Edit command can as well be used to convert the category of tasks. For instance, a todo task can be converted to a deadline task by editing the endTime of it. 

For example, a task with index 2 is a todo task. Entering the command below converts it into a deadline:<br>
`edit 2 to/23/04/2017 19:00`

To convert an Event task to a deadline task, the startTime of the task should be cancelled. This can be done by entering the following command, where we just leave the field after prefix "from/" empty.<br>
`edit 3 from/`

### 2.5. Finding all tasks containing any keyword in their name: `find`

Finds tasks whose names contain any of the given keywords.<br>
Format: `find [KEYWORD1]  ...`

> * Only the name field is searched.
> * Only full words will be matched e.g. `Go Home` will not match `Going Home`

Examples:

* `find pokemon`<br>
  Search for tasks with "birthday" in description
* `find birthday family`<br>
  Search for tasks with "birthday" and "family" in description

### 2.6. Deleting a task : `delete`

Deletes the specified task from the Task Manager. Irreversible, meaning this operation cannot be undone.<br>
Format: `delete [INDEX]`

> Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
> The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `delete 2`<br>
  Deletes the 2nd task in the Task Manager.

### 2.7. Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the Task Manager.<br>
Format: `clear`

> Irreversible.

Exits the program.<br>
Format: `exit`

### 2.9. Undo command : `undo`

Enter<br>
`undo`
> Your previous action has been undone.

As we entered a clear command in the previous section, if we enter an undo, the deleted tasks will be restored.

Currently, `undo` can be used to undo `mark`, `delete`, `add` and `clear` commands only.

### 2.10. Mark command : `mark`

Mark a task an completed or incomplted in the Task Manager.<br>
Format: `mark [INDEX] completed` and `mark [INDEX] incomplete`

## 3. FAQ
